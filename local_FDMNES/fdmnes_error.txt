 The absorbing atom is not inside the area of calculation !

 When the calculation is performed on a cluster of atoms,
 it can be due to the calculation radius which is too small.
 So try again increasing the radius foth both the SCF and the Xanes.

 Another solution is too check in the list of selected atoms below,
 which takes into account the ponctual group symmetry, if the absorbing atom is in the list.

 - if not, choose another atom in the list equivalent by symmetry of the space group, or of the ponctual group.
 The equivalent atoms can be found under "Symsite" in the bav file.
 Then you can use the keyword "Absorber", to choose the equivalent atom as absorber.

 - if yes or if the previous method does not work, just change the order of the atoms, under "Crystal",
   or "molecule", putting first the selected atom or at least before the one giving the problem.
